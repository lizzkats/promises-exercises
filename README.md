# Promises Exercises

Base repository for the [promises-applied](https://github.com/GuildCrafts/web-development-js/issues/186) goal.

## Description

Complete the exercises in the folder `promise-it-wont-hurt-solutions` & `pg-promise-exercises`. Look at the `README.md` file in each folder for instructions.

Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you…

Are familiar with SQL (the core-sql goal is highly recommended)
Are familiar with object oriented programming in JavaScript
Are interested in learning about JavaScript Promises
Are interested in creating functions which use Promises
Are interested in learning how to use the pg-promise library
Description

A theoritical and practical approach to understanding JavaScript Promises.

This goal makes heavy use of external resources: the Promises Course course on Udacity.

For the first two days you will be working on existing courses and completing tutorials. Then you’ll use your skills to complete a set of exercises, and submit your solutions as your artifacts.

Fork the two repos promise-it-wont-hurt-solutions and pg-promise-exercises which contain the exercises you need to complete, and make them your artifacts.

Context

JavaScript is an asynchronous programming language, and if you want want to avoid callback hell you will have to learn to use Promises.

Promises provide a simpler alternative for executing, composing, and managing asynchronous operations when compared to traditional callback-based approaches. They also allow you to handle asynchronous errors using approaches that are similar to synchronous try/catch.
